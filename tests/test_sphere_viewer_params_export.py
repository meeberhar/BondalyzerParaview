"""Unit tests for the sphere_viewer "Save Parameters" diagnostic export.

Covers the JSON parameter snapshot helpers added to ``sphere_viewer``:
1. ``save_params_to_dict`` -- builds the JSON-safe snapshot from a duck-typed
   state object (the trame ``state`` satisfies the same protocol).
2. ``load_params_from_dict`` -- validates and coerces a saved payload back
   into a flat dict safe for ``state.update()``.
3. ``default_params_path`` -- the deterministic output naming.

The control-key coverage test reads the module source the same way
``test_sphere_viewer_reduction.py`` does, so the export cannot silently drift
out of sync with the controls wired to ``@state.change``.
