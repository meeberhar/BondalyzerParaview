"""Saddle Launch Vector Subroutine for gba_topology2 (Basin Locator Step 2).

Given a saddle critical point, determine the directions in which the separatrix
(streamline) branches leave it, and produce the on-sphere seed positions from
which Step 3 integrates them.

Why not the Hessian?
--------------------
The obvious approach -- diagonalise the surface Hessian and take its
eigenvectors -- works only for a simple 2-fold saddle. A monkey saddle
(fold order k = 3) has an identically vanishing quadratic term at its centre
(the normal form is f = x^3 - 3xy^2), so the Hessian is degenerate and its
eigenvectors are arbitrary. The same failure hits every higher-order saddle
this project exists to resolve, and the effective saddles produced by the
catastrophe stage are exactly those cases.

The method used here
--------------------
Work with the cyclic link, which is discrete Morse theory's own description of
a saddle. Order the neighbours of v cyclically around v on the sphere and read
off the sign of f(u) - f(v) around the cycle. The sign alternates in exactly
2k sectors: k upper sectors (f > f(v), ridges, ascending / unstable manifold)
and k lower sectors (f < f(v), valleys, descending / stable manifold),
interleaved. The crossings between them are the separatrix directions, and the
bisector of each sector is the branch launch direction. This is uniform in k:
k = 2 gives the familiar 2 + 2 cross, k = 3 the 3 + 3 monkey, k = 4 the 4 + 4
octupolar cross, with no case analysis and no degenerate linear algebra.

The sector count is also a measurement, not an assumption: it is compared
against the multiplicity the Morse detector already reported
(multiplicity mu = k - 1) and the discrepancy is reported, so a saddle whose
observed fold order disagrees with its index is visible in the viewer rather
than silently traced with the wrong number of branches.

Frame contract: all inputs and outputs are in the CENTRED atom frame, where the
nucleus is the origin and the outward normal of a surface point p is p / ||p||.
The viewer maps the launch positions to the world frame with
``sphere_frame.to_global`` before drawing.
