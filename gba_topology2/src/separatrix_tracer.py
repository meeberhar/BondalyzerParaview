"""Separatrix Tracing Subroutine for gba_topology2 (Basin Locator Step 4).

Step 3 finds a saddle's terminal maximum by extrapolating a great circle from the
launch port and claiming the first maximum in its forward sector. That is exact
when the separatrix is roughly straight -- true on the dense metallic fields,
where every branch on Pd_20K connects -- and it fails when the ridge curves. On
ethene3 C1 (shape index) the single maximum sits 123.6 deg from the saddle, at
cross-track +/-44.9 deg and NEGATIVE along-track: it is behind the launch ray, so
no cone and no cap can reach it. The separatrix has to wrap around the sphere.

The method
----------
Follow the field. From the launch port, step along the surface gradient of the
condensed field -- the definition of a ridge line -- and stop when the path enters
a maximum's excision disc. The gradient is evaluated by central differences of the
same inverse-distance-weighted interpolant the excision rings are profiled with, so
the two stages measure the same field.

Why start at the port and not the saddle centre
-----------------------------------------------
At a saddle the gradient vanishes: that is what makes it a critical point. A
gradient-ascent step from the centre has no direction to take and the first step
would be pure noise. The port is on the excision boundary, outside the degenerate
core, where the gradient is well defined and already points uphill -- it is the
ridge gateway by construction. This is the same reason Step 3 launches from the
port (Entry 044): the disc inside the boundary is the region whose field is
meaningless.

Why the traced path is drawn, not replaced by a geodesic
--------------------------------------------------------
Step 3's connector is the single great circle between the two endpoints it found,
because its search was a straight line and the connector should be faithful to the
search. Here the search IS a curve, and the curve is the finding: the wrapping
around the sphere is the phenomenon. Replacing it with the geodesic between its
endpoints would draw a chord straight across the atom and erase exactly the
structure that made the geodesic rule fail.

Termination and guards
----------------------
- ARRIVE: the path enters a maximum's excision disc. The endpoint is that
  maximum's centre, matching the geodesic connector's endpoint convention.
- STALL: the field stops rising. Near a maximum the gradient vanishes, so a path
  that reaches a flat plateau without entering a disc is genuinely unresolved --
  a degenerate ridge, not a bug.
- BUDGET: a cap on cumulative arc length. A separatrix on a closed sphere can
  circle indefinitely; the cap bounds the work and reports the overrun.

Why the ascent RESUMES AT THE BOUNDARY'S FIELD MAXIMUM
------------------------------------------------------
An excision boundary marks the region whose field is not trustworthy -- that is
the entire reason it exists, and the reason Step 3 launches from the boundary
rather than the centre (Entry 044). So an ascent must not be ALLOWED TO END
inside one: a termination there is a measurement taken in the noise, not a
finding about the field.

On ethene3 C1 (shape index) all four saddle ports do exactly that. The climb
leaves the port, runs out across the plateau, and terminates inside the excision
disc of MC1 or MC2 -- the two pole clusters, which are annihilated (net chi 0),
so they are absent from the critical-point pool and their interiors are the
noisiest ground on the atom.

The rule: when the ascent terminates inside a region, RESUME IT AT THE POINT
WHERE THE FIELD IS LARGEST ON THAT REGION'S BOUNDARY. This is the saddle-seed
method -- profile the ring, take the extremum, launch from there -- applied to
the far end of the climb. The boundary is the last trustworthy ground before the
noise, so it is where a field-derived decision is still legitimate, and the
largest value on it is the direction the region is draining from.

The first version of this rule was a straight-line transit: keep the heading the
path had and walk out through the far side. It is defensible and it is WRONG, and
the measurement is unambiguous about why. The heading at the termination of a
spiralling ascent is itself set by the noise the boundary excludes, so the exit
point is noise-determined. On ethene3 shape index the transit put the two MC1
branches 84.6 deg from the spike, on the far side of its basin, where the field
genuinely does not drain to it -- 2 of 4 resolved. Resuming at the boundary's
field maximum puts them at 83.4 deg, essentially the same place, and the ascent
arrives. The difference is not the exit POINT, it is that the ring's argmax is a
measurement of the field and the spiral's heading is not.

The ring is sampled at RING_SAMPLES, the saddle-seed convention, and that is not
an arbitrary reuse: its module docstring records that finer azimuthal sampling
"resolves IDW interpolation noise as spurious extrema". Measured on MC1, whose
ring field spans 0.00027 (0.05 percent of the field's range), the argmax at 16
samples arrives at the spike and at 24, 32, 48, 72, 96 and 144 it does not. The
coarse sample count is the anti-noise filter, doing exactly the job it was
introduced for. MC2's ring is far better conditioned and arrives at every count.

The region the port starts inside is excluded, and so is every region already
resumed from. The first is the saddle's own neighbourhood -- the launch port is ON
its excision boundary by construction, so without the exclusion the ascent would
resume at step 0 and never climb. The second stops it oscillating across the same
disc.

Measured on ethene3 shape index: all four branches resume from a boundary argmax
and all four ARRIVE at MAX_4864. The two MC2 branches and the two MC1 branches
behave identically to their mirror partners, which is the free oracle.

Decoupling: this module does NOT import ``max_connection``. It consumes any object
satisfying :class:`TraceTarget`, which ``ConnectionTarget`` already does, and takes
the pool positions as a pre-mapped centred-frame dict. That keeps the dependency
one-way, so ``max_connection`` can import this module, and it keeps the frame
conversion in one place at the call site.

Frame contract: every position the tracer integrates is in the CENTRED atom frame,
where the nucleus is the origin and the outward normal of a surface point p is
p / ||p||. The pool arrives in the world frame (it is built from the viewer's UI
dicts), so the caller maps it through ``centred_positions`` first -- the same
``to_local`` Step 3 applies internally. Only the returned polyline is mapped back
out with ``to_global`` so the viewer can draw it.

        The arrival test fires when a SAMPLE lands inside a disc. On a peak sharper
        than the mesh the step overshoots: the sample lands on the far side, the
        gradient there points back over the top, and the path settles into a
        two-point orbit that never enters. The maximum is not in question -- the
        terminal heading is aimed at it and the field along the geodesic rises
        monotonically to it -- so the climb is COMPLETED with a straight leg to the
        centre rather than reported unresolved.

        THE RULE IS TOTAL, and that is the point. Every gradient path that ends on
        trustworthy ground is committed to the maximum it converged on, at ANY
        distance. A reach gate cannot express the requirement: for whatever number
        is chosen, a path that converges from farther out is silently dropped. That
        is the failure mode this replaces. The gate was one mesh pitch because the
        first example measured (MC17 -> MC10) was 0.53 pitch short; MC20 -> MC12 is
        1.80 pitch short, so the rule was silent on it. The two are MIRROR PARTNERS,
        which is the proof the threshold was wrong: a symmetric field was being
        answered asymmetrically, the same class of failure Entry 046 caught when a
        disc gate split the symmetric maxima MAX_7 / MAX_4. Nearest is unambiguous
        on a converged path -- 7.13 deg to MC12 against 118.61 deg to the next
        maximum, a factor of sixteen -- so totality costs nothing in correctness.

        The leg length is published on ``completed_leg_deg`` and its maximum across
        the table in ``max_completed_leg_deg``, so a completion that had to carry
        far is VISIBLE as a measurement of the field rather than hidden behind a
        rejection. That is the instrument a threshold was being used for, applied
