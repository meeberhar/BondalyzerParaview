"""Parameter Snapshot Resolution for gba_topology2.

Loading a saved snapshot is more than copying a dict into the viewer's state:
the snapshot may describe a *different* file or a *different* atom than the
one currently open, and the camera may have been captured around a different
nucleus.

This module turns a raw snapshot into an explicit, testable *restore plan*:

- which ``.plt`` file to open,
- which atom to isolate,
- which condensed field to select,
- the control values to push into the state,
- the camera to apply, re-based onto the target atom.

The plan is deliberately inert: it resolves *what* to restore, and the
viewer decides *how*. That split keeps the interesting logic (path
resolution, field fallback, camera re-basing) testable without a browser or
a render window.

Everything here is pure and UI-free.
