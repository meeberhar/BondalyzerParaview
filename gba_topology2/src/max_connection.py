"""Maximum Connection Subroutine for gba_topology2 (Basin Locator Step 3).

A saddle's ascent (ridge) launch branch is the direction the separatrix leaves
the saddle on its way UP toward a maximum. This subroutine answers the question
that direction poses: *which* maximum is this branch aiming at?

The method: WALK THE RAY, CONE FOR TARGETS, DISC FOR OBSTACLES
--------------------------------------------------------------
The ray is a SOLVER, not the connector. Its job is to find the two endpoints of
a connection -- the saddle cluster centre and the maximum cluster centre -- and
the connector drawn is the single great circle between them. The port, the launch
bearing and the boundary crossing are all internal to the search.

Each branch supplies a ray on the sphere, launched from its PORT on the saddle's
excision boundary along the outward geodesic. Every VISIBLE CRITICAL POINT --
maxima, minima and saddles alike -- is scored by its position relative to that
ray, decomposed in the orthonormal frame ``(o, d, n)`` where ``o`` is the unit
origin, ``d`` the unit direction and ``n = o x d`` the pole of the ray's great
circle:

    along = atan2(t.d, t.o)      progress along the ray to the CP's CENTRE
    cross = asin(t.n)            perpendicular deviation from the ray

The candidates inside the forward sector (``0 < along <= max_arc_deg`` and
``|cross| <= cone_pitch * delta_theta``) are walked in increasing ``along``, and
the walk stops at the first CP that is decisive:

- a **maximum** ends the walk and the branch CONNECTS to it. A target is
  captured by the CONE. Where the ray crosses the maximum's excision boundary,
  ``entry = along - acos(cos rho / cos cross)``, is recorded as the ranking key
  (``along_track_deg``) and as how far the ray travels before it reaches the
  basin; it is not a vertex of the drawn connector.
- a **minimum or saddle** ends the walk as an OCCLUSION only if the great circle
  actually enters its excision disc, i.e. ``|cross| <= rho``. Otherwise the ray
  sails past it and the walk continues.

So the disc is the criterion for an OBSTACLE and the cone is the criterion for a
TARGET. Ties break on ``|cross|`` then on id, so the result is a pure function of
the input set and not of its order.

Why the cone captures a maximum, not the disc (measured, user-reported)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Requiring the ray to enter the MAXIMUM's own boundary is tuned backwards. Every
raw maximum's excision radius is one mesh pitch -- 1.61 deg on Pd_20K -- while
the legitimate rays into a maximum ringed by three saddles arrive at cross-tracks
0.0, 1.35, 1.42 on MAX_7 and 0.0, 2.00, 1.98 on its symmetric twin MAX_4. A gate
at 1.61 sits inside that band, so it accepted all three of MAX_7's connections
and rejected two of MAX_4's: identical geometry, different answers, decided by
noise. The connector counts came out 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3 across the eight
symmetric maxima. Capturing by the cone, which is the directional criterion the
sector already encodes, gives all eight maxima exactly 3.

Why the disc blocks an obstacle, not the cone (measured, user-reported)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Scoring an obstacle's CENTRE occludes on NEAR MISSES, because the cone is
necessarily wider than any single disc. On Pd_20K curvedness, saddle MC18's
branch 0 was blocked from its maximum MC38 by a minimum MIN_19165 at
``along 7.5, cross 7.4`` -- a 1.6 deg object the ray passes 7.4 deg clear of. It
is not an obstacle; the ray sails past it. It was a candidate only because the
9.6 deg cone is six times wider than its disc, and it won because its centre is
nearer than MC38's. Requiring the ray to enter the obstacle's disc takes the
occlusion count on that snapshot from 20 to 0 and MC18 connects to MC38.

Why the disc is an ELLIPSE evaluated toward the ray
---------------------------------------------------
An excision boundary around an elongated set is a fitted ellipse, not a circle.
Using its semi-major as a disc inflates the transverse reach by the aspect ratio:
on Pd_20K shape index the bridged corridor MS13 (a = 11.35, b = 2.43, aspect
10.6) occluded a ray passing 3.58 deg off its axis, because 3.58 < 11.35 while
3.58 > 2.78. :func:`directional_support_radius` evaluates the boundary in the
direction of the ray. This is the same failure the bridging gap test already
fixed for the same reason (``string_aggregator.cluster_directional_support_radius``),
whose docstring names it: an isotropic radius "turns a long thin corridor into a
disk of radius a and lets it swallow compact fragments sitting far off to the
side".

Why the previous rule was wrong (measured, user-reported)
--------------------------------------------------------
The first version took the smallest ``|cross|`` with ``along`` as a tie-break.
That scores AIM and never checks REACH, and it fails in three ways:

1. **Collinear maxima are the degenerate case, structurally.** A ray that
   passes through the maximum MC109 and on to MC143 has ``cross(MC109) = 0``
   and ``cross(MC143) = 0`` -- both lie on the great circle by construction, so
   cross-track is provably unable to separate them. Only ``along`` can, and it
   was the secondary key, consulted only on a bit-exact tie. On a dense field
   that is not rare: across the four saved Pd_20K snapshots the mean cross-track
   of a claim was 0.19-4.4 deg, i.e. many maxima sit essentially ON each other's
   rays, and float noise at 1e-11 rad was deciding a physical question.
2. **The pool was maxima-only**, so the rule could not express "passes through a
   critical point" at all -- it never looked at the critical points that were
   not maxima.
3. **The drawn arc is the saddle->winner geodesic**, so the renderer faithfully
   drew the occlusion the matcher had ignored. That is what made it visible.

Why the sector is a constant, not the branch's own sector width
---------------------------------------------------------------
The obvious per-branch, parameter-free cone is ``LaunchBranch.sector_width_rad``,
the angular gap between the two separatrix crossings bounding the branch's
ascent sector. Measured on the four snapshots it is unusable: on Curvedness 40
of 72 branches report width **0.0 deg** and several report **355-357 deg**; on V
four report 352.6 deg. It is the span between bounding crossings, which
degenerates whenever a sector contains all of them. So the half-angle is the
pitch-relative ``CONE_PITCH`` below, and the number of tunables stays at one.

This is deliberately the SIMPLEST possible connector: a great circle, no field
integration, no barrier test. Step 4 replaces it with the traced separatrix, and
the value of having it early is that the traced path has something to be
compared against -- a geodesic that lands on a different maximum than the
integrator does is a measurement, not a surprise.

The ray origin: the port, not the saddle centre
----------------------------------------------
The excision path (``excision_launch.py``) places ``launch_position`` on the
ring and ``tangent_direction`` at that port, pointing outward from the ring
centre. The saddle centre is the ring centre. Two rays are defensible:

- ``"port_tangent"`` (the DEFAULT): origin = the port, direction =
  ``tangent_direction``, the outward continuation measured AT the ring.
- ``"chord"``: origin = saddle centre, direction = the centre->port bearing.

They are the same great circle -- ``_outward_tangent`` builds the port direction
as ``radial * port - centre``, the parallel transport of the centre->port
geodesic, so both share the pole ``centre x port``. They differ ONLY in where
``along = 0`` sits, which shifts by the ring radius. That shift is the whole
reason the port is the origin: **the disc inside the excision boundary is the
degenerate core whose field is meaningless -- that is the entire reason the
boundary exists.** Launching from the centre means the connector's first ~ring
radius traverses that core, and any critical point the ring swallowed (a leaked
neighbour, per the RING > CENSUS finding) sits on the ray and occludes it. From
the port, every CP inside the boundary has ``along < 0`` and is automatically
excluded. Measured on Pd_20K curvedness, MC18's ring is 8.3 deg and the
occluding minima sit at along 7.5 -- inside the core, so the port origin removes
them by construction, and the disc test removes the off-ray ones.

The mode stays an API parameter (not a viewer control) because it cannot change
the winner on a clean field, and Step 4's integrator starts at the port.

Reciprocity
-----------
Claims are one-way: a branch claims the first critical point it runs into. A
connection is flagged ``mutual`` when it is the tightest claim on that maximum,
i.e. the maximum also points back at this branch. The flag is reported, never
used to gate, because a non-mutual claim is exactly the signal a crossing
separatrix produces -- hiding it would hide the phenomenon.

Occlusion is NOT reported as a mere absence. A branch blocked by a minimum or a
saddle carries ``status == "occluded"`` and the blocker's id, because "this ray
flies over a minimum on the way to that maximum" is a topological finding about
the field, not a failure to find a target.

Step 4: the ray resolves, the field finishes
--------------------------------------------
The ray is a straight-line rule, so it can only find a maximum that lies
FORWARD of the port. On the organic fields (ethene3) the separatrix leaves a
saddle, curves, and arrives at a maximum that sits BEHIND the launch direction:
the measured along-track is negative, so no cap or cone widens the ray enough to
see it. Such a branch is INCOMPLETE, and the field itself supplies the answer.

When the ray reaches nothing, the branch is climbed: ``separatrix_tracer``
integrates the surface gradient uphill from the port and stops when it enters a
maximum's disc. The record carries ``method == "gradient"`` and the traced
polyline as its connector -- flattening it to the geodesic between its endpoints
would erase the wrapping that made the ray fail, which is the finding. The
viewer draws these in cyan against the gold great circles.

The gate is recorded on every unresolved branch (``failure_gate``): ``behind``
(the maximum's along-track is negative), ``cone`` (outside the forward sector),
``cap`` (past the arc-length ceiling), ``occluded`` (a disc entered first) or
``empty`` (no maximum in the pool). This makes the two-stage design auditable --
"the ridge curves" and "the ridge is merely long" are different statements about
the field, and only the first is what the ascent exists to capture.

Occluded branches are NOT rescued. An occlusion is a resolved verdict: the ray
found the first critical point, and climbing the field from the port would
contradict the geodesic rule that produced it. Only ``no_target`` is incomplete.

The fallback is inert when ``mesh_pts``/``f_vals`` are omitted, which is the
contract on a dense metallic field: every Pd_20K branch resolves geodesically, so
the whole connection table is byte-identical with the field supplied (verified
against the HEAD baseline on both shape index and curvedness).

Frame contract: seeds carry CENTRED positions (``SaddleLaunchSeed``), maxima
carry WORLD positions (``BasinCenter``). Pass ``center`` (the world-frame
nucleus) to map the latter into the centred frame; the whole computation runs
centred, where ``p / ||p||`` is the outward normal, and every emitted coordinate
is mapped back out with ``to_global`` so the viewer can draw it. Omit ``center``
only for origin-centred synthetic meshes, where the two frames coincide.

    The first-hit rule can only express "this ray flies over a minimum/saddle on
    the way to that maximum" if the minimum/saddle is in the pool. Maxima and
    minima come from ``extract_basin_centers``; saddles do NOT -- that function
    emits extrema only. So the visible saddles are added here from two sources,
    which is the recurring "effective CPs have no mesh vertex" trap:

    - raw saddles that survived reduction (``vertex_id not in hidden``), whose
      ``CriticalPoint.position`` is in the CENTRED frame;
    - ``E-SAD`` entries of the viewer's effective-CP dicts, whose ``position`` is
      already in the WORLD frame (an effective CP has no vertex to scan).

    The two frames are reconciled here with ``to_global`` on the raw saddles, so
    every emitted position shares the world frame the basin centers use. Omit
    ``center`` only for origin-centred synthetic meshes, where the frames
    coincide -- on a real molecule they do not, and mixing them puts the raw
    saddles up to 4 R off the sphere.

            saddles are not visible and must not occlude.
        center: World-frame nucleus, used to map the centred raw saddles out.

            the reduction reports (``index_agrees``).
        blocker_id: Id of the critical point that occluded this branch, and its

            the straight connector between its endpoints, a gradient connection is
            the traced ridge line, because the wrapping IS the finding there.
        failure_gate: For an incomplete connection, which test rejected the

    Why the disc must be directional here. An excision boundary around an

    ray to MAX_4 passed it at cross-track 3.58 deg -- outside the 2.78 deg
    transverse radius, inside the 11.35 deg isotropic one -- so the corridor
    occluded a maximum it never touched, and the eight raw maxima around the
    pattern lost one connection each.

    This is the same failure the bridging gap test already fixed for the same
    reason (``string_aggregator.cluster_directional_support_radius``), whose
    docstring names it: an isotropic radius "turns a long thin corridor into a

        seeds: Saddle launch seeds, in the centred atom frame. Both the verified

            connection table matches what the scene draws; each record carries
            ``verified`` so the two stay distinguishable.
        targets: EVERY visible critical point -- maxima, minima and saddles --
            each carrying its excision-disc radius. A branch that flies over a
            minimum toward a distant maximum is occluded, which the rule can only
            see if the minimum is in the pool. Build with
            :func:`build_connection_pool`.
        sphere_radius: Atom sphere radius R.
        delta_theta_mesh_rad: Intrinsic angular mesh pitch, to read the cap and
            the sector half-angle.
        center: World-frame nucleus. Required when ``targets`` carry world
            positions (they do, coming from ``extract_basin_centers``); the
            output arcs are then emitted in the world frame too.
        max_arc_deg: Arc-length cap in DEGREES (an angular reach, not a mesh
            multiple -- see the constant).
        cone_pitch: Forward-sector half-angle in mesh-pitch units.
        direction_mode: ``"port_tangent"`` (default) launches from the port on
            the excision boundary; ``"chord"`` launches from the saddle centre.
            See the module docstring for why the port is the origin.
        mesh_pts: (N, 3) mesh vertices, centred frame. With ``f_vals`` this enables
            the gradient fallback for branches the ray cannot resolve. Omit both
            to keep the pure geodesic rule (the unit tests do exactly that).
        f_vals: (N,) condensed field values on ``mesh_pts``.
        find_k_nearest: Spatial index over ``mesh_pts`` for the ascent's IDW
            samples. Strongly recommended alongside the two above.
        excision_regions: Noisy discs the gradient climb may cross but must not
            END inside -- the micro-cluster excision boundaries, built with
            :func:`separatrix_tracer.excision_regions`. An ascent that terminates
            in one is transited straight through to the far rim and resumes
            climbing, because a termination inside a boundary is a measurement
            taken in the noise the boundary exists to exclude. Empty (the
            default) keeps the pure Step 4 ascent, which is the contract the
            geodesic unit tests pin.

    Returns:
        One :class:`MaxConnection` per (seed, ascent branch), in input order.
        Deterministic: the winner depends only on the candidate SET, never on
        its order.

        f_vals: Field values, or None to disable the fallback.
        sphere_radius: Atom sphere radius R.
