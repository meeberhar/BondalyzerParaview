"""Self-Calibrating Excision Ring Search for Launch Seeds (Basin Locator Step 2).

Chooses the excision radius for each saddle, then delegates the port reading to
``excision_launch``. This module owns the *policy*; ``excision_launch`` owns the
*measurement*.

Why the radius has to be searched
---------------------------------
An excision boundary must be large enough to sit outside the degenerate core of
the singularity it encloses, and small enough to stay local. At a mesh pitch of
1.6 deg, a lone saddle's ring from the excision-radius rule lands at exactly
1 dtheta -- inside the regime where the interpolated profile is dominated by
interpolation noise rather than by the field's own structure. The tell is
topological: a ring still in the core has no clean alternating signature, so its
valley and ridge counts disagree.

So balance is used as a convergence test. The ring is expanded until the port
signature is pure -- balanced, at the fold order the reduction stage reports, and
at least 2 (a balanced 1 + 1 is an extremum, not a saddle).

Why the sweep has no early exit
-------------------------------
The search walks radii from the excision-radius rule to the ceiling and stops
only on success. An earlier revision also stopped when two consecutive radii
agreed on an inflated ``k``, to save profiling time. That is unsound: "two
consecutive radii" counts ladder rungs, and rung spacing is the expand step, so
the criterion is measured in a unit the operator controls. IDW noise is
spatially correlated, so two closely spaced rings agree almost by construction --
a fine, thorough scan terminated prematurely while a coarse one survived, and
which saddles produced seeds depended on the step size. The expand step is a
resolution knob and must not be able to change the topology that is found.

Measured on Pd_20K: E-SAD_MC22 lost its seeds at expand step 0.75 and recovered
them at 1.25, purely from this effect. Removing the early exit makes the outcome
invariant in the step, which is the property the regression test pins.

What accepting on the target k costs
------------------------------------
Expanding until ``k == expected_k`` makes the ring a *constructor* of the index
rather than a measurement of it: a genuine index disagreement and a ring that
never resolve look identical from the outside. They are separated here by
recording the observed ``k`` at the tightest radius where the loop was balanced.
A ring that balanced at k = 2 while the reduction claimed k = 3 is reported as an
index mismatch, which is a finding about the Morse detector; a ring that never
balanced at all is a degenerate-core problem. Those are different diagnoses and
they get different counters.
